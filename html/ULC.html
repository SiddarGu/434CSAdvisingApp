      <h2>
        Upper Level Concentration
      </h2>
      <p>The Upper Level Concentration (ULC) requirement is unique to the Computer Science department at the
        University of Maryland. Computer Science is highly interdisciplinary, so studying an area outside of CS
        that can complement your CS studies will set you apart from other candidates in interviews for
        internships and full-time positions. The ULC is a great opportunity to strengthen soft skills and
        discover how you can make your degree stand out. This is also a great opportunity for Computer Science
        students to be creative in how they incorporate other disciplines into their studies. For example,
        someone interested in game programming may do an upper level concentration in English to get more
        experience with creative writing, story telling, and building a narrative. <strong>&nbsp;All Computer
          Science majors must complete 12 credit hours of 300-400 level courses in one discipline outside of
          Computer Science. Courses should be chosen in consultation with your advisor.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li aria-level="1">No CMSC courses, or courses cross listed with CMSC courses (e.g., AMSC460), are
          eligible for the Upper Level Concentration</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Only up to 3 credits from an independent study or experiential learning course may be
          used</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Students pursuing a minor or a double major/dual degree may use those upper level
          credits in this area with the exception of a few majors/disciplines (e.g. Information Science)</li>
        <li aria-level="1">ULC does not need to be related to Computer Science</li>
        <li aria-level="1">ULC does not count as “overlapping courses” between a major/minor</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Courses with a grade of P can be used for the ULC <strong>only</strong> if they were
          taken in the Spring 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters</li>
        <li aria-level="1">ULC courses must be completed with a cumulative GPA of 1.7 or higher. Courses with a
          grade of D can be used for the ULC as long as the cumulative GPA for the ULC is at least 1.7</li>
        <li aria-level="1">If you are doing a second bachelor’s degree, usually the ULC can be satisfied with
          courses from your first degree. <strong>Please consult with your advisor.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The ULC is updated in your audit manually by your assigned advisor. If a course is not showing,
          please contact your advisor and ask them to update it.</strong></p>

        Choosing your Upper Level Concentration Area
      </h2>
      <p><strong>This is not an exhaustive list, so please consult with your advisor about each class you plan to
          ensure you will satisfy this requirement.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li aria-level="1">If courses from different disciplines can be used for a minor, then those courses can
          also be used to satisfy the ULC</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Students using Math or Statistics courses for the ULC are able to mix and match their
          courses between MATH and STAT, however:
          <ul>
            <li aria-level="2">The first STAT4xx cannot be used for the ULC because it is required for the
              CS major.</li>
            <li aria-level="2">Students in the STAT minor typically need to take an additional course to
              finish the ULC after they complete the minor</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li aria-level="1">Students in the ASTR minor typically need to take an additional course to finish the
          ULC after they complete the minor</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Students using ENGL cannot use the Professional Writing (FSPW) course toward the ULC.
        </li>
        <li aria-level="1">Students unsure of their ULC area can consult the <a
            href="https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/">Schedule of Classes</a> for a full list of course
          offerings, and

        are required courses for the Business Analytics minor and cannot be used for the ULC, so students
        thinking about the minor in Business Analytics will need to plan their courses for the minor/ULC
        cautiously.</p>
