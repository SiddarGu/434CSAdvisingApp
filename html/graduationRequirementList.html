                <p>
                    All students, regardless of specialization, must complete 12 credit hours of 300 - 400 level courses
                    in one
                    discipline outside of Computer Science with a cumulative GPA of 1.7 or higher in this coursework. No
                    course
                    that is in, or crosslisted as, CMSC may be counted in this requirement (e.g., AMSC460). Only 1
                    independent
                    study or experiential learning course may be used. Students who are pursuing a minor or a double
                    major/dual
                    degree may use those credits in this area with the exception of a few majors/disciplines (e.g.,
                    Information
                    Science). Please consult with your advisor to ensure the courses you plan to take to ensure they
                    will
                    satisfy this requirement. For a detailed breakdown of accepted Upper-Level Concentration courses

                    Students within the Computer Science major may choose to pursue our General Track or one of three
                    specializations offered. Students are not required to pursue a specialization but may find one best
                    fits
                    their interests. Students interested in declaring a specialization should speak with their assigned
                    academic advisor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students, regardless of specialization, are required to fulfill their computer science upper level
                    course requirements from at least 3 areas. Courses that fall within each area are listed in the
                    General
                    Track degree requirements. The five areas are: Area 1: Systems, Area 2: Information Processing, Area
                    3:
                    Software Engineering and Programming Languages, Area 4: Theory, Area 5: Numerical Analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For tracks requiring CMSC electives, three 1-credit CMSC STIC courses are equivalent to one 3-credit
                    300-400 level elective course. Visit UMD's official STICs website and our FAQ page for more
                    information
                    on STICs and see your assigned advisor for information on how STICs can fit into your
                    specialization.
